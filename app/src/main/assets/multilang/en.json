	"visuals.windows.wndstory.chapters_metropolis": "Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.",
	"visuals.windows.wndstory.chapters_prison": "Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts were left locked up here.",

	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_4": "When you are attacking or being attacked, the first thing to be determined is whether this attack was a hit or miss. In general, the chance to hit depends on the attacker's Accuracy value and the defender's Dexterity value. Different characters and even mobs have different growth rates for these values.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_5": "Dexterity value of the defender is decreased by 1/16 of its value for every occupied or impassable tile near it. This means that you should lure your enemies to narrow corridors if you want to miss less often, and you'll want to stick to the open areas if you want to dodge more reliably.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_6": "All ranged attacks consider attacker's Accuracy to be decreased by 1/8 of its value for every tile of distance. The only exception for this rule are flintlock weapons. Only wands of Magic Missile can miss, but they use your magic power instead of accuracy to determine your chance to hit.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_7": "For the player character (and some late-game mobs), every consecutive hit after the second one slightly increases damage done by the attack. This is shown by the \"combo\" message over your character and can significantly improve your effectiveness against packs of mobs.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_8": "Your Perception attribute affects your chances to find a trap or a secret door by walking near it, as well as your chance to hear an enemy through the wall. Mind that secrets become more difficult to find as you descend further into the dungeon.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_9": "High grass is extremely useful for setting up ambushes, as it both blocks field of view and makes you stealthier. However, water is noisy and will decrease your stealth when you are standing in it.",

	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_11": "Searching or lighting your lantern guarantees that all secrets on nearby tiles (such as traps or hidden doors) will be revealed to you. Keep in mind that a lit lantern also makes it guaranteed for enemies to notice you, however.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_2_12": "Your Attunement very significantly affects wands recharge rate, and also determines chance to prevent equipping cursed item when it is unidentified. Magic skill determines strength of your wands and also affects effectiveness of certain offensive scrolls.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_1": "Melee weapons are separated into different categories. The most basic of them is heavy one-handed weapons which do not have any special abilities or penalties and can be used in any combination of weapons without strength penalties.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_2": "Light one-handed weapons can be equipped in your off-hand, but will require additional strength to use them in such way. Dual-wielding increases your attack speed by 50% and allows you to parry as well.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_3": "Light two-handed weapons are basically different kinds of polearms. They are not intended to be dual-wielded and will require additional strength if you want to use them in this way. However, they can be used with shields just fine.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_4": "Heavy two-handed weapons are not intended to be used with shields or other melee  weapons. Throwing weapons and wands do not count as weapons here. Also, mind that if your second hand is empty, you can use your main weapon to parry.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_5": "Throwing weapons can be equipped in your offhand slot. They can't be upgraded, but they allow you to attack from distance while keeping your melee weapon equipped. They never degrade, but they have a chance to break on use (same applies for ammunition as well).",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_6": "Ranged weapons require both hands to use - one to hold the weapon and second to hold its ammunition. Without ammunition, you will attack as if you had no weapon at all. Every kind of ranged weapon requires specific kind of ammunition.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_7": "Flintlock weapons require bullets in your offhand to shoot and gunpowder in your inventory to reload. Also, loud noises tend to draw unnecessary attention. However, firearms are equally accurate on any distance and they penetrate target's armor.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_8": "Always have at least some kind of armor equipped. Proper armor will greatly increase your chances of survival, decreasing damage from most sources. It will not protect from non-physical damage though, such as fire, lightning or disintegration.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_9": "Cloth armors offer very little protection but they can enhance one of your secondary attributes - Stealth, Detection or Willpower. This bonus can be increased by upgrading the armor, and can lead to some powerful (but risky) character builds.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_10": "Shields occupy your offhand slot, but they increase your armor class with a 50% chance and are more effective at blocking enemy blows. When blocking or parrying enemy blows, you have a chance to leave your enemy open to a counter attack, which will be a guaranteed hit.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_11": "Wands can be very powerful, but you need to equip them and they have a limited number of charges. Unidentified and cursed wands can miscast occasionally. Some wands spend all of their charges on use, and their effect depends on amount of charges used.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_3_12": "Rings are rare trinkets which can greatly help you when equipped. They are not really powerful by themselves, but effects of similar rings stack with each other. Cursed rings will hinder your abilities instead.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_1": "Most equipment can be upgraded. Upgraded items are much more powerful than common ones, they deal more damage, offer better protection, require less strength, have higher amount of charges, recharge faster and are more durable. However, items cannot be upgraded more than three times. Keep that in mind.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_2": "Weapons and armors can be enchanted. Enchantments provide some unique effects such as bonus fire damage or resistance to acid, but chance of them working significantly depends on the upgrade level of your weapon. Also, cursed items reverse the effects of their enchantments, turning them against you.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_3": "Some items may happen to be cursed, which means that you will be unable to unequip them until curse is removed (with help of certain scrolls and potions). Cursed items offer the same damage/protection as non-cursed ones, but they require more strength to be used and break faster. Items which are too good for the current chapter have a much higher chance of being cursed.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_4": "Most equipment has condition level. It slowly decreases as the item is used, but can be restored with the corresponding repair tools or scrolls of Upgrade. Every condition level affects item performance just as much as upgrade level does, but it doesn't affects the strength requirement of the weapon or the number of charges of the wand.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_5": "Your character needs food to survive. There is always at least one ration at every floor; you can also find some food in shops or dropped from certain mobs. Your regeneration rate is increased when your satiety is over 75% and halved when it is 25% or lower. When your satiety hits 0%, it will cause periodical damage from starvation.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_6": "Your most readily available source of healing are your waterskins. When used, waterskin recovers part of your missing health, and can be refilled in occasional water fountains. There is always at least one fountain per chapter.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_7": "In the darkness of the dungeon, ambient lighting is barely noticeable, limiting your field of vision. To counter this, you can use the lantern you start with. It basically nullifies your Stealth though, so use it wisely.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_8": "If you have some spare gunpowder, you can use it to craft makeshift bombs. These bombs can be dismantled back to give you some of the gunpowder spent on them, and they can be combined into even more powerful bomb bundles.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_9": "Scrolls can be very powerful when used correctly. Some of them can lead to your quick demise if used incorrectly. There is no way to know which scroll is which, unless you try to read it or find one in a shop.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_10": "On your quest, you can find randomly colored potions. Some of them are beneficial and some of them are harmful. Beneficial potions buff you when used, and harmful potions are better to be thrown into your enemies.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_11": "Sometimes in the high grass you can find alchemical herbs. You can either eat them to cleanse and prevent certain debuffs, or use them in alchemy pot for brewing potions or cooking raw meat.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_4_12": "If you find inventory to be too limiting, consider buying bags in the shops. A bag unlocks separate inventories for herbs, potions, scrolls or wands. Additionally, it will protect these items from harmful effects (like fire).",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_1": "As you explore this dungeon, you'll meet many adversaries on your path. Defeating your enemies is the main source of experience to level up your character, but you'll need the level of threat of your opponents to be appropriate to see any improvements.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_2": "Dungeon is filled with monsters to the brim, and even as you kill them, it will always spawn more to get you. Some mobs can even drop something useful on death. Be careful not to rely on that too much though. Each time the dungeon spawns another creature, respawn time on the current floor is increased a bit.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_3": "Every denizen of this dungeon possesses some special abilities, but in general all of them can be separated into several categories. Most common enemies like rats and flies usually have higher dexterity and stealth, but their attacks are weaker and they can't take a good hit without, you know, dying horribly.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_4": "A bit less common enemies like muggers, skeletons or brutes usually do not have any significant drawbacks or advantages. Some of them can even try to attack you from short distance, but these attacks are usually weaker and they will always switch to melee when damaged.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_5": "Some enemies possess proper ranged attacks though, and they will use them whenever possible. Even worse is that most of these enemies also deal non-physical damage which ignores your armor class. On the other hand, some of them also need to spend a turn to charge their attack before that.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_6": "There are also some mobs which are a much greater threat than others, being strong, durable, and pretty accurate as well. Their only weakness is their very low dexterity. They are also more susceptible to be ambushed and are much easier to be heard.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_7": "While in general, most enemies belong to certain chapter and will never spawn out of it, some enemies can be encountered in any part of the dungeon. They grow in strength to always represent adequate threat for the current floor. Most of them also have some kind of weakness which makes dealing with them much easier.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_8": "However, bosses take the cake for being the greatest threat in this dungeon. All of them are very powerful, durable and possess unique abilities. Worst of all, you can't evade the fight with them and you have to defeat them to descend deeper into the dungeon. They require preparation and attention to be defeated, but some of them also possess certain tricks to make fight with them easier.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_9": "But keep in mind that not everything in this dungeon wants you dead. Some denizens of this dungeon are quite friendly and can even give you a short quest to complete. Obviously, doing what they ask will net you a proper reward, but they can be simply ignored if you want, it will have almost no effect on your future progress.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_10": "Some of these NPCs do not want anything from you... except for your gold. There will be small shop on every fifth floor where you can sell your surplus items and buy something in return. Assortment and quality of items in these shops depends on the current chapter, but some of the items are guaranteed to be sold.",
	"visuals.windows.wndtutorial.txt_points_5_11": "Finally, keep in mind that some of the enemies in this dungeon are of magical, unnatural origin, and thus can be immune to some effects which require living flesh and thinking mind to be affected. But this also makes them susceptible to some other effects which do not affect natural, living creatures.",
